        <p>
          I grew up in a small town located in Newfoundland called Heart's
          Content. I graduated high school and moved to Nova Scotia where I
          studied Human Services at NSCC. I worked in mental health for over 20
          years, now I am starting a new journey to become a Full Stack Web
          Developer.
